## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS & Flexbox

### What I learned

The universal selector (*) all the elements on the page.
box-sizing: border-box property, includes the padding and border in the total width and height of the element.
```css
* {
  margin: 0; 
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

The ::marker CSS pseudo-element - selects the marker box of a list item (bullet or marker).
```css
li::marker {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm to continue honing my skills in responsive web design, focusing specifically on mastering CSS Flexbox and Grid techniques.
